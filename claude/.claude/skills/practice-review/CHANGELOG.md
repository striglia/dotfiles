## 2026-02-08 — Add Practices Evolution (Phase 6)

**What changed:** Added Phase 6 "Practices Evolution" to the review process. After logging the review, the skill now checks whether any practices should graduate (mastered habits), be added (emerging patterns), or be sharpened (high-variance definitions).

**Why:** After 4 sessions of reviews, a pattern emerged: some practices (like "Steer, Don't Row") were consistently scoring 9-10 and creating tracking noise, while review notes kept suggesting new practices that never got promoted to `practices.md`. The practices were static while the user was growing.

**Three evolution types:**
- **Graduate** — 9+ over 5+ sessions → move to "Graduated" section
- **Add** — recurring "Focus" notes or emerging patterns → propose new practice
- **Sharpen** — variance > 4 points → propose splitting or adding triggers

**Evidence from reviews:**
- "Steer, Don't Row": 9, 8, 8, 10 — candidate for graduation
- "Minimize Compaction": 5, 3, 10, 9 — candidate for sharpening
- "Weekly Reflection Quality": suggested in 2026-02-08 review — candidate for addition
