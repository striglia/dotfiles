# My Development Practices

Personal practices I'm actively working to improve. Used by `/practice-review` for end-of-session reflection.

## Spec & Planning Work

### Conversational over Waterfall
- Engage iteratively with specs rather than building everything upfront
- Ask clarifying questions early, before deep implementation
- Share partial progress to validate direction
- Treat specs as living conversations, not fixed contracts

**Signs I'm doing well:** Asking questions, showing incremental work, pivoting based on feedback
**Signs I'm slipping:** Building large features before checking in, "big reveal" moments, rework after misunderstanding

### Co-Design in Plan Mode
- Use plan mode to co-design approaches before committing to implementation
- Even for well-specified tasks, pause to consider design alternatives together
- Bring messy, half-formed concepts early rather than polishing them in isolation
- Let Claude help shape the idea, not just execute a finished spec

**Signs I'm doing well:** Starting sessions in plan mode, sharing rough ideas, exploring alternatives before building
**Signs I'm slipping:** Arriving with fully-formed specs, skipping design discussion, treating Claude as executor not collaborator

## Context & Session Management

### Minimize Compaction
- Prefer shorter, focused sessions over marathon sessions that hit context limits
- Use targeted file reads instead of dumping entire files
- Be intentional about what context is loaded
- Exit and restart sessions when context is getting heavy rather than compacting

**Signs I'm doing well:** Sessions end naturally, context stays manageable, no compaction needed
**Signs I'm slipping:** Hitting context warnings, compacting mid-session, losing important context
